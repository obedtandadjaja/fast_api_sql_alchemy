# fast_api_sql_alchemy
Fast API + SQL Alchemy ORM sample project

This project is made solely to explore the features of Fast API and SQL Alchemy ORM. In particular, I am trying to find out the following things:

- How easy it is for new developers to use (ease of use)
- Performance (latency + speed)
- Maturity (production ready or not)
- Breadth of features
- Community size (Stackoverflow community + documentation + github contributors + online articles)

In trying to find out these things, I will be creating a simple web server with authentication in mind. This ensures that I do some kind of middleware to verify users accessing private pages. I will be building a secret message delivery system much like onetimesecret.com. Of course, I will not put a lot of thought into the architecture of the system, since I will be focusing on the functionality of the frameworks and library that I am using.

## Running the project

```
make start
```
